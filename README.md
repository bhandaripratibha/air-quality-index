# Air-quality-index
Using pollutant data (CO, PM₁₀, NH₃, SO₂) collected across multiple cities and monitoring stations, we aim to derive meaningful insights into real-time air quality levels.

# Air Quality Monitoring Analysis (India)

## 📘 Dataset
- Source: data.gov.in
- Contains pollutant data across cities, stations, and pollutants (CO, PM10, NH3, SO2)

## 🔍 Analysis
- Cleaning and transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## 📈 Key Plots
1. Pollutant count frequency [Pollutant_count.jpg](https://github.com/bhandaripratibha/air-quality-index/blob/main/Pollutant_count.jpg)
2. Distribution of pollutant averages
3. Top 10 polluted cities
4. Correlation heatmap
5. Station map by pollutant

## 💡 Insights
- PM10 & CO most common pollutants
- Some cities show average pollutant levels > safe limits
- Strong correlation between min, max, avg

## 🧠 Tools
Python · Pandas · Matplotlib · Seaborn · Google Colab
